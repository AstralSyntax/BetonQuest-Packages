I made this as easy as i could for everyone! We wil go through setting it up for all your future quest needs!

### Files ###
First make sure your files are in the correct place -
BetonQuest>QuestTemplates>QuestTracker>pacakge.yml

### Placeholder Usage ###
To correctly use the math in this then please make sure you have Papi installed on your server! Run the following commands and you're all set:
```
/papi ecloud download player
/papi reload
```

### Variables ###
All variables are clearly marked

### Quester Info ###
Contains information about the NPCs
### Base Reward ###
Contains the math and information for your reward payouts

### Base Block Amount ###
Contains the math and information for you block amount selectors

### Repeating Quest ###
Contains the time variable for a "cooldown" of quest

### How to use this in my quest? ###
All you need to do is call on the variables using `$variable$` to display them! Or to edit them in packages just add a `variable:` section!

Displaying reward payout math in npc text -
```
NPC_options:
  quest_complete:
    text: |
    Hi %player%, here is your reward! &a$rewardPlaceholder$
```
$rewardPlaceholder$ will result in displaying the number output from that math variable.

Editing variables like npc names and quest descriptions -
```
At the top of every one of your quest package.yml files at this -

package:
  templates:
    - QuestTracker
    
variables:
  questerName: Bob The Builder
  <other variables you want>
```
Displaying the NPC name -
```
conversation.yml -
conversations:
  steve: # This part still needs to be the Citizens NPC Name
    quester: "$questerName$"
```
```
Or you can display it in a notification such as -
events:
  Notify_QuestComplete: "notify &aQuest Commplete&7! &fReturn to $questerName$ to get your reward!"
```
You can edit any of the following variables under each quest packages `variables:` section
- Base Reward
- Base Block Amount
- Repeating Quest

How do i use this in objectives? Easy!
Simply call on the math variable inside your objective as the `amount` selector!
```
objectives:
  objective_MineCoal: "block COAL_ORE $blockPlaceholder$"
```
Will result in a quest of breaking coal in the amount of whatever the math equals to from the variable! Amount is set to raise based on levels
```
objectives:
  objective_MineCoal: "block OAK_LOG $blockPlaceholder$"
```
Will reult the same way but for breakin Oak Logs

Displaying quest names - Set your quest name in your variables at the top of your package.yml of your quest packages
```
variables:
  mainQuestName: Mining Quest III
```
Then you can display this anywhere using the placeholder - `%%`


```
events:
  setMainQuestName: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.QuestTracker QuestName "$mainQuestName$"'
  setMainQuestObj1: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.QuestTracker1 Objective1 ""'
  setMainQuestObj2: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.QuestTracker2 Objective2 ""'
  setMainQuestObj3: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.QuestTracker3 Objective3 ""'
  setSideQuestName: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.SideQuestTracker.QuestName ""'
  setSideQuestObj1: 'variable QuestScoreboardTracker.SideQuestTracker1.Objective1 ""'
```

displayed with the placeholders -
```
%betonquest_QuestTracker:objective.QuestTracker.QuestName%
%betonquest_QuestTracker:objective.QuestTracker1.Objective1%
%betonquest_QuestTracker:objective.QuestTracker2.Objective2%
%betonquest_QuestTracker:objective.QuestTracker2.Objective3%
%betonquest_QuestTracker:objective.SideQuestTracker.QuestName%
